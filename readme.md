## Description:

#### Goals:
- Build a forecasting model to predict future web traffic for approximately 145,000 Wikipedia pages.
- Investigate the effectiveness of LSTM neural networks in handling multiple time series for this prediction problem.

#### Assumptions:
- The model is expected to forecast web traffic for 7 days based on the historical traffic from last 90 days.
